Subtitles for Manually Installing Extensions.
Unpacked extensions are often made available as a zip file. 

Double-click the
zip file to extract the extension in an
easy-to-access location such as the
desktop. 

Launch Google Chrome and expand
the chrome menu found in the top right
corner of the browser window. 

Go to more tools and click extensions.

In the top right section of the extensions page.

Enable developer mode. 

Once developer mode is enabled, you can use the, load
unpacked, button to load an extension. 

In the file selection dialog, select the
folder of the extracted extension. 

Now the extension has been loaded into the
browser and is ready for use. 

You may need to refresh some web pages for all
functionality to take effect. 

You can also click on the details button for
more information and settings. 

If the extension has additional options, they
can be accessed here on the details page.

You can also manage the options at any
time by right-clicking on the icon of
the extension in the chrome menu and
selecting options. 

Once you've tested your unpacked extension, you can
uninstall it by clicking the remove button in the main extensions page.
